### About

This tool includes an implementation of five gradient-based algorithms, including 

*    (1) Steepest Descend Algorithm (SDA),
*    (2) Conjugate Gradient Algorithm (CGA),
*    (3) Newton's Method,
*    (4) Davidson-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) Method,
*    (5) Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) Method,

for multivariate function optimization. For two variable functions, a user-friendly interactive interface is available which portrays the optimization procedure step-by-step. 
This toolbox can also serve as an educational tool to understand mainstream optimization techniques.
